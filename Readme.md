## Description
AppStore Replica pretends to be a **copy of the App Store layout made entirely in SwiftUI**. In order to structure the project, views have been divided into **three groups: Screens, Blocks and Elements**. **Screens** are made up of the **sum of views that generate a complete screen in the app**, while **Blocks** are basically **partial views that are used multiple times** during the project. Finally, **basic views** like buttons, labels or lists belong to the **Elements** group.

The **goal** of this project is to **put into practice the concepts learned in SwiftUI** and understand better how views are divided, reused and connected in a multi-tab-application.


## Preview
Those are the most relevant screenshots of the app.
